TODO
----
* Add support for resuming incomplete downloads (context menu item, then call recordingDownloader.resumeDownload()).
* Add support for resuming errored downloads (context menu item, then call recordingDownloader.resumeDownload(), but we need to introduce one more overload, to force-start from zero).
* Add support for deleting downloads
* Add support for purging all downloads
* In RecordingDownloader, show alert if Kodi is shutting down?

DONE
----
* In recordings.py, save each playlist in its own dedicated folder
* In recordings.py, serialize RecordingDownloadProgress (into the folder above) every time a segment is downloaded.
* Create new extension class (Downloads.py or something like that) to display list of downloaded items. This will cycle through the subdirs that contain a RecordingDownloadProgress serialization file with a known filename.
* In RecordingDownloader, check for Kodi shutdown if download in progress
* Periodically refresh Downloads list to show download progress
