TODO
----
* Create new extension class (Downloads.py or something like that) to display list of downloaded items. This will cycle through the subdirs that contain a RecordingDownloadProgress serialization file with a known filename.
* In RecordingDownloader, check for Kodi shutdown if download in progress and, if so, show alert.
* Add support for resuming incomplete downloads.

DONE
----
* In recordings.py, save each playlist in its own dedicated folder
* In recordings.py, serialize RecordingDownloadProgress (into the folder above) every time a segment is downloaded.
